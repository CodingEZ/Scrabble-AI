"# Scrabble" 

Welcome to playing Scrabble with an AI!
Contained here are some of the instructions for using this repository.

## Requirements

1. tkinter
2. itertools (a convenient way to make permutations)

## How to Use

Download the entire repository and unzip it. The programRun.py file is 
the main file. Running it will allow you to play the game.

It takes two clicks to move letters, one on the original square and one 
on the target square. Clicking pass will pass the turn, though preferably
you remove all of the new letters before doing so. Also, the play button 
check if you have followed basic scrabble rules and checks if the words 
you created belong in the scrabble dictionary. So far, the other buttons
are funky.

Beyond that, play away and follow the directions on the right. The AI will 
play the best word given its letters. Good luck!
